## Disclaimer

> Please, read this **_thoroughly and carefully_**, or your comission will be refused due to not agreeing with the terms presented in this document.

- **NO AI POLICY**: it is **NOT** allowed to use my art for any AI related purpose (e.g. gen ai). Do **NOT** upload my work to any AI related website.
  - Modifications done through AI processing are **NOT** allowed.
- **NO NFT POLICY**: usage for NFTs is **completely forbidden**.
- If you aren't comfortable with these Terms of Service, and / or you don't agree with the conditions, your commission request won't proceed.
