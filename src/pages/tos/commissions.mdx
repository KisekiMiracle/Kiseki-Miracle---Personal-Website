# Terms of Service

---

## Disclaimer

> Please, read this **_thoroughly and carefully_**, or your comission will be refused due to not agreeing with the terms presented in this document.

- My current situation is rough on the edges, and there may be days where I won't be able to work. If there is any eventuality on my end, I will let you know if the work may be delayed.
- I give consistent updates throughout the commission's progress. If there are small fixes or changes, good chances are that they will get a green light.
  - **Small tweaks/changes**: mostly fine until the end of the project. Always ask.
  - **Substrantial changes**: I will let you know if a change is too big to be done at the current point of the commission progress.
- I require references to work, even if a Character Design service is on place. This can be either descriptions (e.g. how they look, how they talk, about their personality, etc) or audiovisual resources (with pictures/illustrations being the most useful).
  - Try to be as clear as possible with your request. Being unreasonably ambiguous or attempting to change opinions/ideas too often, will make very likely that major changes end up denied, and the commission will proceed from there on without changes in direction—or it will be terminated.
- If your budget is thight, I invite you to contact me and discuss the scope of the project. We may reach an agreement. I can also fraction payment in installments. (see [Payment Information](#payment-information))
- **I reserve my right to refuse a commission.**
- **NO AI POLICY**: it is **NOT** allowed to use my art for any AI related purpose (e.g. gen ai). Do **NOT** upload my work to any AI related website.
  - Modifications done through AI processing are **NOT** allowed either.
- **NO NFT POLICY**: usage for NFTs is **completely forbidden**.
- If you aren't comfortable with these Terms of Service, and / or you don't agree with the conditions, your commission request won't proceed.

If you have any questions, please reach out via [vGen⮺](https://vgen.co/KisekiMiracle/portfolio) or [Discord⮺]() (_prefered_). Additionally, you may contact me at [contact@kiseki-miracle.dev](mailto:contact@kiseki-miracle.dev).
